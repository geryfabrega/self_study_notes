This algorithm is a way to avoid unnessary [[Compacting]] that may occur due to [[External Fragmentation]]
There are many algorithms see
[[Best-Fit]]
[[worst-fit]]
[[first-fit]]
[[buddy algorithm]]

See Look up Wilson et al, (not sure the full name but look it up to see an good survey of best efficiencies of each memory alg)
