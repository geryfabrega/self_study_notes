When given a start and end time, lets merge all the overlappig intervals.

When merging all the intervals , the result will be all NON overlapping intervals

"[[[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]]"

Take in put list of intervals and sort by the start value.

-Does the current intervals overlap with the previous interval? If so, merge them.
-Drawing a number line to understand the problem makes the problem easier to visualize
